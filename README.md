## Advent of Code

My repository for the yearly [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

### Utilities

I also have added a few utilities.

- `bin/start` - creates the files and downloads the input for the day. Needs a `.cookie` file for the last part
- `bin/run` - runs the file and returns the output

Both accept an argument for the date. When left empty it will default to the current day.
